# springboot-reactjs-maven
This is a partial copy of a Spring Boot backend contain a ReactJS frontend packaged with Maven.
It contains a number of React cases.
Each case can be initialized by uncommenting the case (and commenting the current one) in /src/myreactapp/src/index.js
When uncommenting Person, you will get a React frontend with a controller in the backend (unfortunately called greeting controller).
